# Predicting heart disease diagnosis

## Description
This application predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd heart_disease_prediction


#### step 1: Organize Your Project Structure

heart_disease_prediction/
│
├── backend/
│   ├── app.py               # Your Flask application
│   ├── heart_disease_model.pkl  # Your trained model
│   ├── requirements.txt      # List of dependencies
│
├── frontend/
│   ├── index.html            # Your HTML file
│   └── style.css             # Your CSS file (if you have separate CSS)
│
└── README.md                 # Instructions and documentation


## Description
This application predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input.

##   Installation

### Step 2: Create a Requirements File
Inside your backend/ directory, create a file named requirements.txt and list all the dependencies you need. For example:

Flask
Flask-Cors
joblib
numpy


You can generate this file automatically using pip:

pip freeze > backend/requirements.txt

###  Step 3: Create a README File
Create a README.md file in the root directory to provide instructions on how to set up and run your application. Here's a basic template:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd heart_disease_prediction
2. cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python app.py
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000

Frontend
The frontend files are located in the frontend/ directory. You can open index.html in your browser.

Model
Make sure to place your pre-trained model heart_disease_model.pkl in the backend/ directory.


### Step 4: Create a ZIP File for Distribution

Once your structure is in place and everything is working as expected, you can create a ZIP file for distribution:

1. Navigate to the parent directory of `heart_disease_prediction` in your command line or file explorer.
2. Compress the `heart_disease_prediction` folder into a ZIP file.

### Step 5: Test Your Package

Before sharing your package, it’s a good idea to test it on a different machine (or a virtual environment) to ensure everything works as expected. You can do this by unzipping the file, installing the dependencies, and running the app again.

### Step 6: Share or Deploy

Now you can share your ZIP file or deploy your application to a cloud service like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean, depending on your needs.
